# Emmas-Small-Engine
This is a website built for a fictional company called Emma's Small Engine.

This was a project done with 4 other group members. I created and added functionality to the "Reports" page and was in charge of the design using Bootstrap.

# Downloading Instrucions
Unfortunatley Github doesn't push built libraries so... 
  1. Open ESELibrary.sln and build the solution.
  2. Open ESEWebsite.sln and build the solution (you may have to wait a few minutes for the references to load, etc).
