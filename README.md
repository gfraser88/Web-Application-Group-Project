# Emmas-Small-Engine

This was a project done with 4 other group members. I created and added functionality to the "Reports" page and was in charge of the design using Bootstrap.

# Downloading Instrucions
Unfortunatley Github doesn't push built libraries so... 
  1. Open ESELibrary.sln and build the solution.
  2. Open ESEWebsite.sln and build the solution (you may have to wait a few minutes for the references to load, etc).


# The Case
Here is the made up case for the lawn mowing repair company called "Emma's Small Engine"

Sales of robotic lawn mowers are beginning to take off, and with fewer and fewer people
interested in maintaining their own equipment, there has been a spike in the need for businesses willing
to sell and then support different lawn care equipment. Emma’s Small Engines was a small family
operation until they were hit by the increased demand for services. In the last few years, they have
expanded by adding a new sales department and taking in large numbers of new customers. The speed
at which they have expanded is starting to create stress within the business’ system as they try to use
the old, antiquated system to meet new demand.



Current System

Currently, when a customer enters the business they are met by a sales representative who tries
to determine what the customer needs. If they are there for a repair and/or to make a purchase (versus
just looking for advice or information), the sales rep records the customer’s information in the one
computer at the front desk. Here, they use the Sale Record template to record the basic customer
information and other data related to the transaction.




Purchases

If the customer makes a purchase, the sales person completes the Sale Record and final
transaction in the same single computer. If the item is in inventory, it is removed from the shelf and
given to the customer. If it is not in inventory, the Sale Record is printed and delivered to Parts and
Ordering who places the order using their specialized ordering system. The company purchases the
item, an order number is written on the Sale Record and the document is kept in a binder that is used to
compare against deliveries so that the orders can be filled.
When an order arrives, the Parts and Ordering department compares the arrivals to items in the
binder, the Sale Record is retrieved from the binder, the Parts staff add a 1% markup to cover shipping
and receiving costs (only applied to ordered parts, not those from current inventory), record the new
cost beside the item, and the information is returned to the sales team to find the Sale Record in the
computer, contact the customer, and complete the sale.


Repairs

If the customer is there for a repair, the sales rep completes and prints 2 copies of the Repair
Request form (two copies of a Sale Record with the repair listed as a line item), one is attached to the
customer’s device and the device is placed in the yard to wait for the technicians. The second copy is
placed on a clipboard and added to the bottom of the pile for the technicians to get to.
Some machines enter the shop that are still covered by warranties. If a machine is covered by a
warranty, the sales associate will include that information as part of the description in the line item.
Then when the work is completed, the customer is not charged for the work, but it has to appear on the
order as warranty work.

In the shop, the technicians will take a clipboard, write their starting time on the Repair Request,
and bring the device into the shop. There, they begin the process of determining the issue and repairing
the device. Once done, they write their stop time, write down any parts used and pass the Repair
Request back to sales who create a new Sales Record from the provided documents and call the
customer.

If the repair requires parts that aren’t part of the shop’s inventory (a small inventory of oil and
common parts are kept in house), the technician fills out a part request form by hand (taken from
specially printed note pads), takes it over to Parts and Ordering, writes their stop time on the Repair
Request and puts the clipboard back onto a hook for those jobs requiring parts. Parts processes the
order using their ordering system, writes the order number and the part number(s) on the document
and places the order into a separate parts binder. When the part(s) arrives, and is confirmed by the
Parts department, the Parts staff add a 1% markup to cover shipping and receiving costs (only applied to
ordered parts, not those from current inventory), record the new cost beside the item, and pass the
document back to the shop.


The technician retrieves the clipboard, writes their start time, staples all paper work to the initial
Repair Request and completes the repair. When done, they write their stop time and pass the sheet
back to sales. Sales then creates a new Sales Record using all the attached documents and contacts the
customer. When the customer arrives, sales reviews the repairs with the customer and finalizes the sale.


Once Sales has finalized a sale and the customer leaves satisfied, all the Sales Records are
passed to the admin whose job it is to enter all the paperwork into a series of Excel templates that
allows the admin to create a series of reports that management needs to run the business. And the
documentation is placed in filing cabinets by customer last name in case they are required.



Additional Notes

A sale record can also contain both a sale and repair. Usually, the whole bill is paid for at once
upon completion of the repair. If the customer wants, the sale can be completed separately using a
separate sale record. In this case two sales records will be issued.


Inventory

Inventory is currently handled using an Excel spreadsheet where at the end of the week, the
sales staff must perform a true inventory. To perform the inventory process, one of the sales staff will
count and call out the number of items they can see, and then the other sales staff will record the
numbers in an Excel spreadsheet.
If an item needs to be ordered, the sales staff use the same order request sheets that the
technicians use. After filling out what they need, the sheet is sent to Parts and Ordering. The same
process is followed for ordering and receiving the item (including the 1% markup). Once Sales has the
new stock, they modify the Excel spreadsheet with the details (quantity, cost before markup), add an
additional 10% markup to the cost and place the items on the shelf.



The Case

Emma has seen the stress levels of her staff rising over the last few months. The technicians,
Eugene and Sarah, are overworked and spending far too much time on paper work. Emily, the
administrative assistant has recently taken stress leave and sales reps (Wendy and William) can barely
keep up. And, Sam in Parts and Ordering is swamped with papers and deliveries that are piling up more
everyday. Even pitching in, Emma isn’t able to make much difference in the workload and when she
does, she loses time that she needs to spend on advertising, merchandising and simply just keeping the
books up-to-date. Errors are creeping into the business documents and trying to eliminate these errors
are creating more stress.

In an effort to save her apparently struggling business, Emma has approached a local college to
try and find help for her predicament. The college business outreach department has advised her that
their computer programming department may be able to help her.
After meeting with the staff, they have assured her that their students would be able to help.
The college has created teams of students who will tackle Emma’s problems and design a system that
will help her, and her team integrate all systems and improve business tracking hopefully eliminating
several errors. Emma will pick the best application to implement.
As part of the project, the students, with Emma’s help, get a chance to meet with key members
of the team and ask some pointed questions to determine if they understand the system correctly and
that they know what each person requires from the new system.



Staff Interviews


Emma’s Interview (Owner)

“What exactly are you looking for?” asked one student.
“What I’m looking for is a program that will streamline and interconnect our processes and
remove the need for paper. We are using more and more paper, it’s expensive and we are starting to
lose and misplace some of that paperwork,” replied Emma. “I also need to create a few reports that
currently require a lot of time to create. Emily can fill you in on those reports.”
“Are you willing to spend some money to get new equipment such as a computer for the shop
area?” asked another student.
“Yes, though I don’t want to spend exorbitant amounts of money. I will try my best if it will help
my team adjust to the increased sales.
“I also want to show my appreciation to my staff. I would love to have a way to calculate say a
.02% portion of any sales (including shop work) that I can put aside so I can have a staff party once a
year. That means that with combined sales and repairs of $10, 000, I would have put aside $200 over the
year. I just want to give back to my team.”



Sam’s Interview (Ordering and Purchasing)

“Your system currently uses two specialized systems, one for sales and one for ordering parts.
Do we need to integrate those into this new program?”
“The ordering system is a proprietary system, so I doubt we could. In the new system, if I had a
place to enter the order number, the item ordered, the price and the order it is attached to, I could live
with having to transfer the information from system to system. It would be even better if in the new
system, I could search for the order number to complete the delivery.
“The sales system is really just a web look up to see if our partners carry the item, so it really
isn’t all that specialized.”



Eugene and Sarah (technicians)

“What would you like to see from the new system?”
“We’d love to stop looking for pens,” jokes Eugene with a sideways glance at Sarah. “With so
many tools in the shop, pens go missing all the time.”
“And, a better way to track our time on task would be awesome,” adds Sarah. “We do
sometimes forget to record stop and start times so we have to estimate. It’s not fair for the customers.
Also, it might be a great idea that if we had a task, such as changing a key, we could look up how long
the last one took us so that we can better tell the customer, if they ask, how long it might take and plan
our day to get more done.

“Oh, and one more thing. Would it be possible to have a way to better mark a repair that
requires a warranty? When we do warranty work, we need to keep better notes because to be paid for
the work, we need to collect all our work notes and send them off to the company who reimburses us
for the work done. We need to know if a job is warranty, so we can ensure we are providing enough
detail. Currently, it’s hard to catch the note when it’s written on the repair line and we’ve sometimes
lost the payback because we didn’t see it and didn’t provide the right information.”



Wendy and William (Sales)

“We keep typing in the same information all the time. It would be wonderful if we could get a
system that remembers stuff we’ve entered like a certain type of repair and then allows us to select it
from a list to save us typing time. Or, if we have a repeat customer, that we can call up their personal
info and equipment info with a single click.
“And, a way to automate the inventory system would be awesome. We’ve recently run in to an
issue where we tried to sell an item, but our inventory numbers aren’t updated until the end of the
week and we think the item is there, but we sold out of it earlier in the week. This has happened a few
times recently and can only get worse. It would be nice to have a system where we can see real-time
numbers for our on-hand inventory and if we are getting low, order some.”



Emily (Admin)

“Save me time. I spend so much time entering numbers and doing calculations that I have no
time to do the other parts of my job. Mondays and most of Tuesdays are write offs as I enter the
paperwork from the week before and the paperwork keeps getting higher and higher. And, now, there’s
no money or time to higher part-time staff to help.
“There are two key reports that I would love. Both would be new to us, so you have some
freedom in design: a new Weekly Review and the warranty report.
“The first is the Weekly Review. This document would take all the information for the last week
and create an overall summary of the week’s monetary events. It would be nice to see total sales broken
down by repairs and sales. Totals for inventory used and totals for items that had to be ordered. Emma’s
.02% and how much of the total orders is actually for shipping and receiving.”The second is the warranty 
report. I need to find the jobs for a company, say all warranty work for Yamaha, and create a report
that lists the job, a summary of the work performed and our final cost for the work. It takes forever
to produce that report by hand.”
